IDA* Puzzle solver assignment for the Parallel Programming Practical(PPP)

This template contains everything required for the java assignment (provided you have an internet connection).

Content:

- bin/run-java
            script to run java applications (with correct classpath)
            start from the same dir as this README.

- bin/ipl-server
            script to start an "ipl-server" (see IPL documentation
            for more info). Note: this script will only work once you ran "./gradlew".

- bin/ibis-run
            script to start an ibis application on the local host.
            This script starts an ipl-server, and instances of the application.

- bin/ibis-prun
            script to start an ibis application on DAS5 (to be used with prun).
            This script also starts an ipl-server, so you don't have to yourself.

- bin/sanity-check
  bin/reference.out
            script to compare output of your ipl version with the reference output.

- build.gradle
  gradle
  gradlew
  gradlew.bat
            build mechanism to build your application using Gradle.
            Build your application using the command "./gradlew".
            This will download everything required to build and run IPL apps.
            It "rewrites" the jar file to optimize serialization performance.

            Also contains a "submit" target ("./gradlew submit") to create
            a zip file suitable for submission.

- docs
            put your documentation here.

- ibis
            directory containing IPL configuration.

- ibis.properties
            settings file for Ibis. Please don't change it.

- log4j.properties
            settings file for Log4J (see http://logging.apache.org)
            needed for the IPL, automatically used by scripts in bin.

- src
            source of the sequential application. Your code should
            also go here (empty packages provided).
